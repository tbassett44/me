# The ME Framework
This framework is designed to run/host distributed internet applications with the ease of use of both developers and users in mind

#Primary Design Rules

The primary design rules are as follows:
	- Make workflow as efficient and simple as possible
	- End users of apps should not be encombered by any additional setup
	- Developers should be able to build applications without having to think about the back end/security
	- All data should be hash-chained to ensure data integrity
	- The Modules should be interoperable with the ability to have multiple front ends that can be remixed/mashed together in different ways
